Supported EEG hardware
======================

The mindaffectBCI can supports different ways to connect to amplifiers allowing us to work with many different amplifiers.   Here we give an overview of the main connection types and the supported amps. 


BrainFlow Connections
+++++++++++++++++++++

The primary amplifier connection type is provided by `brainflow <https://brainflow.org/>`_.  Thus any amplifier supported by brainflow can be used by the mindaffect BCI with a simple configuration file change.  

Internally, we have most experience with:
  * openBCI `Ganglion <https://shop.openbci.com/products/ganglion-board?>`_ with 4 water-based EEG electrodes over the occiptial cortex using our 3d printed `headband <https://mindaffect-bci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/printing_guide.html>`_.
  * openBCI `Cyton <https://shop.openbci.com/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel?variant=38958638542>`_ with 6 to 8 water based EEG electrodes over the occiptial cortex using our 3d printed `headband <https://mindaffect-bci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/printing_guide.html>`_


BrainProducts LiveAmp
+++++++++++++++++++++

`BrainProducts <https://www.brainproducts.com/>`_ have generously provided us with hardware to test their `LiveAmp <https://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=63>`_ mobile EEG system.   We have tested this with gel electrodes in a cap with 8 electrodes at the 10-20 locations: P07, O1, Oz, O2, PO8, Pz, P0, Iz.
