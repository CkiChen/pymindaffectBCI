# MindAffect BCI: 1st Run Quickstart


# Installation

Requirements:



*   Python installation (Suggested:[Installation â€” Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) - Version 3.6.9) 
*   Bluetooth 4.0 dongle - (BLED112)

 

Before installing the mindaffectBCI make sure you have the following packages installed in your python environment:



*   Pyglet (Version 1.3.2)
*   Scipy (Version 1.4.1)
*   Numpy (Version 1.18.1)
*   Matplotlib (Version 3.2.1)
*   Brainflow (Version 3.3.1)

If you are missing one or more of the packages listed above, install them as follows:



1. Open the (anaconda) command prompt
2. `pip install "package name"`

Then, to install the MindAffect BCI: (For now we use a local pip install)



1. Place the supplied pymindaffectBCI folder in a directory of your choice. 
2. Open (or navigate to) the pymindaffectBCI folder in the (anaconda) command prompt.
3. Install the pymindaffectBCI package by typing (including the dot!):

    For anaconda users: `pip install -e .`


    For others:`pip3 install -e .`



# Running the MindAffect BCI software

The system consists of 4 main components as illustrated here:

![mindaffect BCI system architecture](../docs/SystemArchitecture.png "mindaffectBCI system architecture")


To actually run the BCI we need to start each of these components:



*   UtopiaHub: This component is the central server which coordinates all the other pieces, and saves the data for offline analysis
*   Acquisition: This component talks to the *EEG Headset* and streams the data to the Hub
*   Decoder: This component analysis the EEG data to fit the subject specific model and generate predictions
*    Presentation: This component presents the User-Interface to the user, including any BCI specific stimuli which need to be presented. It also selects outputs when the BCI is sufficiently confident and generates the appropriate output. This 1st run tutorial will use the python based Selection Matrix as its presentation component

To launch all these components at once:



1.  Power on the  OpenBCI Ganglion. (toggle on/off button)
2.  Open a command prompt / your Anaconda virtual python environment
3.  Run the BCI by typing: `python -m mindaffectBCI.online_bci`

If all is installed it should start the selection matrix with all the other components in the background.

When the blue light on the ganglion does not turn solid after starting the BCI you most likely have to change the com port for your bluetooth dongle. Change the 'serial_port' option in the online_bci file around line 24 to match your dongles port. You can find the used com port as follows:

On Mac:



1. Open a Terminal session
2. Type: `ls /dev/cu.*`, and look for something like /dev/cu.usbmodem1(or similar): \

```
$ ls /dev/cu.*
/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Modem		/dev/cu.iPhone-WirelessiAP
/dev/cu.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync	/dev/cu.usbserial
/dev/cu.usbmodem1
```



    Then, in the online_bci file your  serial port should be defined as  `serial_port='dev/cu.your_com_name'`


On Windows:



1. Open Device Manager and unfold Ports(COM&LPT), the com port number is shown behind your used bluetooth adapter.

    Then, in the online_bci file your  serial port should be defined as  `serial_port='COM<em>X</em>'`



# Using the MindAffect BCI:

Now that the system is up and running, you can go through the following steps to use the BCI!



1. EEG headset Setup

    Prepare a headset such that it follows the [MindAffect headset layout.pdf](https://github.com/mindaffect/Headset/blob/master/MindAffect%20headset%20layout.pdf)) in our Headset repository or prepare the headset delivered with your kit by following [MindAffect headset setup.pdf](https://github.com/mindaffect/Headset/raw/master/MindAffect%20Headset%20Set%20up%20instructions.pdf))

2. Signal Quality

    Check the signal quality by pressing 0 in the main menu. Try to adjust the headset until all electrodes are green, or noise to signal ratio is below 5. 


    You can try to improve the signal for an electrode by pressing it firmly into your head. After releasing pressure, wait a few seconds to see if the signal improves. If not, remove the electrode, and apply more water to the sponge. The sponges should feel wet on your scalp.


    If  the noise to signal ratio does not improve by adjusting the headset, try to distance yourself from power outlets and other electronics.

3. Calibration

    Start calibration by pressing 1 in the main menu. Continue to follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Feedback

    You are now ready to try out the BCI by either selecting Copy-spelling (2) or Free-spelling (1)!
